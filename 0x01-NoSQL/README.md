## General Information

### What is NoSQL?

NoSQL databases are a type of database management system that stores and retrieves data using models other than the tabular relations used in relational databases.

### Difference Between SQL and NoSQL

NoSQL databases differ from traditional SQL databases in terms of data models, scalability, and flexibility.

### ACID

ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) is a set of properties ensuring database transactions are processed reliably.

### Document Storage

Document storage refers to storing data in a semi-structured format, often in JSON-like documents.

### NoSQL Types

NoSQL databases come in various types, including document-oriented, key-value, wide-column, and graph databases.

### Benefits of NoSQL Database

NoSQL databases offer advantages such as scalability, flexibility, and ease of development for certain use cases.

### MongoDB and Python

MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database, and PyMongo is a Python driver for MongoDB, allowing seamless interaction with the database.

## Requirements

- MongoDB 4.2
- Python 3.7
- PyMongo 3.10
- Pycodestyle 2.5
